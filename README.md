## Overview
The Rocket Launch Simulation is a computer graphics project implemented using OpenGL. It simulates the launch of a rocket from a launch pad, its ascent into space, and interaction with the environment.

## Features
Realistic rocket animation, Dynamic simulation of rocket motion, Interactive user interface, Instructional home screen, Visualization of stars and planets, Responsive event handling (keyboard input),

## Requirements
OpenGL library, C/C++ compiler, GLUT library (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

## Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine, Compile the source code using a C/C++ compiler, Ensure that OpenGL and GLUT libraries are linked during compilation, Run the compiled executable file.

## Usage
